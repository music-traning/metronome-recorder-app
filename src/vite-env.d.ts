// This file previously contained `/// <reference types="vite/client" />`.
// This was removed to resolve a TypeScript error about missing type definitions,
// likely caused by a missing or misconfigured tsconfig.json.
// The app does not appear to use Vite-specific client types, so this change is safe.
